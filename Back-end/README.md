## Color Features

### Color moment

[Color moments - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_moments)

Three main characteristics in color moment are used to represent color features: 

- Mean

- Standard Deviation

- Skewness

### Texture

The Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) contains the second-order statistical information of spatial relationship the pixels of an image.

Four texture features are calculated from GLCM maxtrix: 

- Contrast

- Correlation

- Energy

- Homogeneity

### Color histogram

[Color histogram - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_histogram)

Color histogram represents the number of pixels that have colors in each of a fixed list of color ranges

## 

## Video Similarity

The similarity of color features are calculated by Euclidean distance
